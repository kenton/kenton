## About Me 👋🏽

I’m Kenton, a Solutions Architect and Engineering Leader who designs and delivers systems at the intersection of technical platforms and real business execution.

I’ve led engineering teams, built and scaled production systems, and applied AI to improve workflow efficiency, decision quality, and product experimentation — always with a focus on adoption, reliability, and outcomes.

## 🤖 Applied AI in Production Systems
I focus on applying AI in production systems where it meaningfully improves speed, quality, or decision-making.

## 🛠 How I Work:
- Use LLMs to accelerate discovery, prototype workflows, and pressure-test system designs
- Apply AI selectively to reduce manual effort and improve decision quality
- Favor simple, debuggable systems over clever abstractions
- Optimize for adoption, not novelty

## 🧠 What I Bring
- 10+ years in software and systems development
- Led remote engineering teams and mentored junior devs
- Designed and delivered scalable systems supporting scalable apps using Rails, React, Next.js, and PostgreSQL
- Focused on velocity, team health, and business outcomes
- Known for mentoring devs, unblocking teams, and aligning engineering work with business goals
