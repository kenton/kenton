## About Me 👋🏽

I’m Kenton — a Senior Full-Stack Developer and Engineering Leader with a passion for clean code, simple systems, and helping people grow. I’ve worked across fintech, mortgage, and SaaS — and I’m deeply excited about where AI is taking us next.

## 🤖 AI-First Builder
I’m actively exploring the intersection of software engineering and AI automation.

🛠 Tools I’m using:
- **ChatGPT** – my integrated thought partner for content, coaching, scaling ideas, and technical decision-making. It’s especially powerful for uncovering blind spots and surfacing perspectives I might have missed.
- **Cursor** – my AI-powered dev environment of choice, enabling faster iteration and better team velocity 
- **Manus** – my go-to for deep research, structured reports, and high-fidelity product planning

## 🧠 What I Bring
- 10+ years in software and systems development
- Led remote engineering teams and mentored junior devs
- Architected scalable apps using Rails, React, Next.js, and PostgreSQL
- Focused on velocity, team health, and business outcomes

## 🔍 Actively Looking For
- **Engineering Manager** or **Senior Developer** roles  
- Remote-first 
- AI-first companies, productivity tools, or financial technology

## 📈 2025 Goals
- Join a forward-thinking engineering team solving complex problems
- Build or contribute to AI-powered SaaS or DevTools
- Continue shipping indie side projects with real-world impact
